                            Sure, the first Inside Out is a beloved, Oscar-winning fan favorite, but that's not a particularly unique designation for a Pixar movie. Still, Amy Poehler looks to lead another strong voice cast, this time joined by Maya Hawke, Ayo Edibiri, Adèle Exarchopoulos, and Paul Walter Hauser voicing new emotions rising up in a now teenaged Riley.

                        <p class="text-dark h3 text-justify">This film, releasing on June 21, 2024, features interconnected stories with a star-studded cast including Emma Stone, Jesse Plemons, and Willem Dafoe. It's expected to be a challenging watch, much like Lanthimos's previous works</p>
                        <p class="text-dark h5 text-justify">Following just behind Bad Boys is the latest collaboration between writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone, whose last film, Poor Things, earned four Oscars, including Best Actress for Stone’s work. Kinds of Kindness is arguably more challenging a film than Poor Things (if you can believe that), as it depicts a trio of loosely connected stories with its cast — which also includes people like Jesse Plemons, Hong Chau, Willem Dafoe, and Margaret Qualley, among others — portraying different characters in each segment.

                    <h1 class="font text-dark text-justify align-middle ms-5">"Kinds of Kindness" by Yorgos Lanthimos:
                        <p class="text-dark h3 text-justify">This film, releasing on June 21, 2024, features interconnected stories with a star-studded cast including Emma Stone, Jesse Plemons, and Willem Dafoe. It's expected to be a challenging watch, much like Lanthimos's previous works</p>
                        <p class="text-dark h5 text-justify">Following just behind Bad Boys is the latest collaboration between writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone, whose last film, Poor Things, earned four Oscars, including Best Actress for Stone’s work. Kinds of Kindness is arguably more challenging a film than Poor Things (if you can believe that), as it depicts a trio of loosely connected stories with its cast — which also includes people like Jesse Plemons, Hong Chau, Willem Dafoe, and Margaret Qualley, among others — portraying different characters in each segment.
